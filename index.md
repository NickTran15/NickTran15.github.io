I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating the year 2027

* Lab 2

 Even though this was the easiest lab to do but back when I was learning the basics of code it was a tough lab because I didn’t know anything and didn’t know how to start the lab. Knowing it is the easiest lab everyone has to start somewhere and this is where I was able to write my first line of code, which is why lab 2 is one of my favorite labs. Being able to write my first line of code that was able to print a message will be very memorable knowing what I wrote worked.


* Lab 7

I enjoyed doing lab 7 because I was able to learn how to use boolean variables. For lab 7, me and my partner had to make a code for signs indicating whether or not a person can park their or not. Doing the lab had a slow transition from easy to hard, the first one being the easiest but the last one had lots of rules to follow which was challenging but managed to get through it.

* Lab 12

The last lab we had to do was make a gif that looked to be color-shifting but in reality, it's just going through the image really fast. I like this lab because we’re creating code that involves movement while the other labs aren’t as exciting. Another thing is that it shows my progress from lab 2 where I was creating a fill-in-the-blank code to the final lab of lab 12 where I create something that has movement.
